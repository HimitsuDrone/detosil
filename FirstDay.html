<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Serif;font-size:60;"> I met a lot of people, both students and teachers. I wrote a whole two pages filled with impressions of everyone new including the requirements. I was serious when I said I vowed to improve this year. I'm happy that the first day was an amazing start to this school year </p>
