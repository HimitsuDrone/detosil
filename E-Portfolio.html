                        Though we were able to work together nicely, we still bickered a bit due to the time pinch and we were pressured into passing the unfinished material. THough if I do say so myself, I'm still glad to have been able to learn more that day.

                        I had quite the fun working on this. It was all about writing about my first day in LPSCI which as mentioned in my output, a pleasant day. I was able to include my favorite song as we were instructed to include an audio file, and include a pciture of the very tree that was one of the things that pushed me to go to LPSCI. Which is a story for another time.

                            The ”x” came from XML or eXtensible Mark-up Language.

I will aim to do better on the next quarter.
